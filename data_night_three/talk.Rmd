# Examples

Almost everything can be a data science problem...

- Residency matching
- 
- FedEx problem

# Residency matching

- How can we *fairly* match medical school graduates with hospitals for residencies?
- Goal: to match applicants to hospitals so that the final result is "stable", i.e. no applicant A and hospital H such that both:
    - No A is unmatched or would prefer to go to H over the hospital he is currently matched with
    - H has a free slot or would prefer A over one of the candidates currently filling one of its slots.
- Won 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics


# FedEx problem

- FedEx needed to pick a hub location that is close to everywhere
- You could use data science for this:

# FedEx problem

# Data science

- Using data, statistics, and logic to answer business questions
- Involved in all steps of the business process
    - Unsupervised analysis
    - Experiment design
    - Experiment analysis
    - Feature creation

# Finance

- Quant funds (Two Sigma, RenTech, etc) make trading strategies from lots of weak signals
- Banks/insurance use data to manage risk
- Consulting: it's data science without data, or science 

# Marketing

- Fundamental question: Who should we target, and how can we reach them?
    - Customer lifetime value and segmentation
    - Targeting, A/B testing, optimization

# Healthcare

- Predictive analytics - readmission rates
- Epidemiology - disease spread modelling
- Diagnosis - [sort of](https://www.mskcc.org/blog/msk-trains-ibm-watson-help-doctors-make-better-treatment-choices)

# Industrial/Manufacturing/Farming

- Lot of operations research, manufacturing optimization
- Oil field discovery, accident/anomaly detection
- Crop productivity, environmental analysis

# Tech

- Product analytics: what features should we implement, and are they working out
- Content: what should we show to who (e.g. FB Newsfeed)
- Lots of data, easy measurement, inherently real time update

# Role breakdowns

- Business analyst: little programming, some SQL, generally financial analysis, basically a consultant
- Data analyst: some programming, some stats, lots of SQL, mostly analysis
- Data scientist: mix of everything
    - "Analysis" DS: focused on analysis and stats, some programming, little to no ML
    - "Building" DS: lot of programming, solid stats, at minimum can prototype ML models 
- Machine learning engineer: deep understanding of ML algorithms, implementation, tuning/optimization
- Data engineer: lot of programming and databases, some statistics
- Also: quant researcher, statistician, quantitative analyst, software engineer ...

# Technical stuff

- Programming: mostly R / Python, sometimes Scala/C++ for performance
- Databases: mostly use SQL, also Hadoop, etc

# What to do

- Learn to program (try [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/))
- Work with open datasets (shoutout [Data For Democracy](https://medium.com/data-for-democracy))
- Consider getting a masters/PhD, turns out this is actually really hard
