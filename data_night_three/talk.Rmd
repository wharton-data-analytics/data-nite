## Examples

Almost everything can be a data science problem...

- Residency matching
- 
- FedEx problem

## Residency matching

- How can we *fairly* match medical school graduates with hospitals for residencies?
- Goal: to match applicants to hospitals so that the final result is "stable", i.e. no applicant A and hospital H such that both:
    - No A is unmatched or would prefer to go to H over the hospital he is currently matched with
    - H has a free slot or would prefer A over one of the candidates currently filling one of its slots.
- Won 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics


## FedEx problem

- FedEx needed to pick a hub location that is close to everywhere
- You could use data science for this:
